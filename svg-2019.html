        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) is a language that allows authors and
          users to describe graphics in a way which is scalable to different
          device resolutions, acessible, and animatable.</p>
        <p>The SVG WG develops a single deliverable, the SVG specification. It
          consists of the following, somewhat independent technologies, all of
          which are in scope for the SVG Working Group: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A <strong>syntax</strong> for retained-model structured graphics.
            Both XML and HTML5 syntaxes are suported. <strong>Styling
              characteristics</strong> are CSS properties, expressed as
            stylesheets or as presentation attributes.</li>
          <!--
        <li>A <strong>processing model</strong></li>        -->
          <li>A <strong>rendering model</strong> which describes how the
            elements of SVG produce a graphical representation</li>
          <li>An <strong>Object Model</strong>, a set of standard APIs, to
            which libraries can be written for manipulating dynamic and
            responsive graphics.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>As a primary focus in this charter period, the group will concentrate
          on the <em>stabilisation</em> and <em>interoperability testing</em>
          of the core SVG 2 specification. As part of that testing, features
          which are in the reference draft of SVG2 and which do not meet the
          stability and interoperability requirements for a Proposed
          Recommendation may be moved to separate specification modules, work on
          which would remain in scope, but at a lower priority.</p>
          <p>As a secondary focus, the group may address modules for new graphical
            features for SVG,
            <!-- <em>only</em> once SVG 2 is at the Proposed
            Recommendation stage and  -->
            once there is broad consensus on adding each
            such feature to the Web Platform. A requirements document will be used
            to collect together these features.</p>

        <!-- <div id="section-out-of-scope">
          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>
            <p>The following features are out of scope, and will not be addressed by this <i class="todo">(Working|Interest)</i> group.</p>

          <h3>Success Criteria</h3>
          <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of each of feature defined in the specification.</p>
          <p>Each specification should contain a section detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>
          <p>Testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>
          <p>
            Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and
            recommendations for maximising accessibility in implementations.</p>
          <p> Modules that reach <a href="http://www.w3.org/2015/Process-20150901/#rec-publication"
            title="Recommendation">W3C
            Recommendation</a>, are considered successful when all of the
          following are present: </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Production of stable documents addressing the work items listed
            in the Deliverables section.</li>
          <li>Test suites for each module with conformance criteria.</li>
          <li>Availability of multiple, independent, interoperable
            implementations of each feature with conformance criteria in each
            deliverable; as demonstrated by an implementation report
            (summarizing implementation status against the relevant test
            suite) for each testable class of product, including user agents.</li>
          <li>Deployment on multiple types of platform.</li>
          <li>User community and industry adoption of the group deliverables.</li>
        </ul>

                  include HTML5-compatible parsing, removes the XLink namespace,
                  and makes many small improvements in clarity and precision in

        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this <i class="todo">(Working|Interest)</i> Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>. Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a> and at least 3 months before <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a>, and should be issued when major changes occur in a specification.</p>
        <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The paragraph above replaces line-item liaisons and dependencies with individual horizontal groups. There's been a suggestion to name and individually link the specific horizontal groups inline, instead of pointing to a page that lists them.</p>
        <p class="issue"><b>Issue:</b> The requirement for an invitation to review after FPWD and before CR may seem a bit overly restrictive, but it only requires an invitation, not a review, a commitment to review, or even a response from the horizontal group. This compromise offers early notification without introducing a bottleneck.</p>

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

      	<p class="todo">In addition to the above catch-all reference to horizontal review which includes accessibility review, please check with chairs and staff contacts of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/APA/">Accessible Platform Architectures Working Group</a> to determine if an additional liaison statement with more specific information about concrete review issues is needed in the list below.</p>

          To be successful, this <i class="todo">(Working|Interest)</i> Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the (Working|Interest) Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>

          This group primarily conducts its technical work  <i class="todo">pick one, or both, as appropriate:</i> on the public mailing list <a class="todo" id="public-name" href="mailto:public-[email-list]@w3.org">public-<i class="todo">[email-list]</i>@w3.org</a> (<a class="todo" href="https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-[email-list]/">archive</a>)

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>). Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via email and/or web-based survey), with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised on the mailing list by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the <i class="todo">(Working|Interest)</i> Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a> and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

        <h2>
          Patent Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This Working Group operates under the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a> (Version of 5 February 2004 updated 1 August 2017). To promote the widest adoption of Web standards, W3C seeks to issue Recommendations that can be implemented, according to this policy, on a Royalty-Free basis.

          For more information about disclosure obligations for this group, please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C Patent Policy Implementation</a>.
        </p>

        <h2>Patent Disclosures </h2>
        <p>The Interest Group provides an opportunity to
          share perspectives on the topic addressed by this charter. W3C reminds
          Interest Group participants of their obligation to comply with patent
          disclosure obligations as set out in <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/#sec-Disclosure">Section
            6</a> of the W3C Patent Policy. While the Interest Group does not
          produce Recommendation-track documents, when Interest Group
          participants review Recommendation-track specifications from Working
          Groups, the patent disclosure obligations do apply. For more information about disclosure obligations for this group,
          please see the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2004/01/pp-impl/">W3C
            Patent Policy Implementation</a>.</p>
