        <p>Only changes of <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#correction-classes">class 1, 2, and 3</a> are in the

          <p>In order to advance to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsPR" title="Proposed Recommendation">Proposed Recommendation</a>, each specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of any substantive errata.</p>

          This Maintenance Working Group will not adopt new proposals. If the Group wishes to add new Recommendation-track deliverables or new features then it can no longer be a Maintenance Working Group and a new Working Group would need to be chartered.
          If the Director may issue a Call for Participation for a Working Group (including a new Maintenance Working Group) that contains one or more of the <a href='#deliverables'>deliverables</a> within its scope, the Director must close this Maintenance Working Group.

          Editorial changes to a Recommendation require no technical review of the proposed changes.</p>

        <p>
          For all specifications, this Maintenance Working Group may seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/Charter.html#horizontal-review">horizontal review</a> for accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.

        <p>
          To be successful, this <i class="todo">[name]</i> Maintenance Working Group is expected to have an active editor for each of its deliverables, including ideally representatives from the key implementors of those specifications.
          The specification editors are expected to contribute one half of a working day per months towards the Maintenance Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group encourages questions, comments and issues as described in <a href='#communication'>Communication</a>.

          Technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public.
          Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed on a public repository, and may permit direct public contribution requests.
        </p>
        <p>
          This Maintenance Working Group will appear on the <a href="">list of Maintenance Working Groups</a>.

        <p>
          This Maintenance Working Group does not have teleconferences or face-to-face meetings.

          This group primarily conducts its technical work on <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="[link to Github repo]">GitHub issues</a>.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This group will seek to make decisions through consensus and due process, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus"> W3C Process Document (section 3.3</a>).
          Typically, an editor or other participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined in discussion with members of the group and other reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting being required.</p>
        <p>
           However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress, but consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a group vote, and record a decision along with any objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Group must not make any resolution in face-to-face meeting or teleconference.

          A call for consensus (CfC) will be issued for document transitions, with a response period from one week to 10 working days, depending on the chair's evaluation of the group consensus on the issue.

          If no objections are raised in the <a class="todo" id="public-github" href="[link to Github repo]">GitHub repository</a> by the end of the response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus as a resolution of the Maintenance Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the group should be considered resolved unless and until new information becomes available, or unless reopened at the discretion of the Chair or the Director.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/policies#Votes">W3C Process Document (Section 3.4, Votes)</a>, and includes no voting procedures beyond what the Process Document requires.

          About this Charter

        <p>
          This charter has been created according to <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/groups#GAGeneral">section 5.2</a> of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process">Process Document</a>.

        <p>
          As long as maintenance is needed and active for the deliverables and no other Working Group takes on any of the deliverables, the Director is expected to grant <a href='https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process//#charter-extension'>one-year charter extensions</a>.
