# Draft charters for public review
This repo is a space for draft charters to be developed for W3C Working
Groups or Community Groups, and to be discussed and refined. No charters that
get added to this repo necessarily have any official standing at all—anyone
can create a draft charter here for public discussion. If you’d like to have
push access to add a draft charter to the repo,
[file an issue requesting access](https://github.com/w3c/charter-drafts/issues) or fork this repo to make a pull request.
